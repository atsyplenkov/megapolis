<div class="clock">
<p>As we are forced to run the school online this year due to COVID-19, there are a few things we’d like you to do before we get started to make things run as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>If possible, please make sure you have a <a href="zoom.us">Zoom account</a> set up through the same E-mail address you used in the registration form <em>before</em> the first session on Thursday 11/26. Thank you!</p>
<p>We will use the same Zoom link for each day of the bootcamp, and you will receive the link via email and slack.</p>
