::: {.clock}
As we are forced to run the school online this year due to COVID-19, there are a few things we'd like you to do before we get started to make things run as smoothly as possible.

If possible, please make sure you have a [Zoom account](zoom.us) set up through the same E-mail address you used in the registration form *before* the first session on Thursday 11/26. Thank you!

We will use the same Zoom link for each day of the bootcamp, and you will receive the link via email and slack.
