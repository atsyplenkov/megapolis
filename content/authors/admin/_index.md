## Multi-Scales and -Processes Integrated Modelling, Observations and Assessment for Environmental Applications
### Online Young Scientist School (YSS) MEGAPOLIS 2021

This YSS will introduce young generation of researchers to special topics in atmospheric and environmental sciences, Earth system modelling approaches and applications, especially
considering transport and fate of small (micro) particles. During the school, participants will learn about the current progress and challenges in Earth system research; meteorological, hydrological and atmospheric composition modelling and observations (including ground-based and remote-sensing); and modern technologies for environmental studies and assessments (including health impacts). The programme will consist of theoretical lectures and practical exercises (to be accomplished by students as small-scale research projects ending with presentation of the project results).

This School was originally planned in August 2020 (Moscow, Russia) as part of the Academy of Finland (AoF) “ClimEco” & Russian Science Foundation (RSF) “MegaPolis” projects, but postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic. 
    Professor Sergej Zilitinkevich (1936-2021) was one the key organizers of the School, promoting for research community, and especially, for the younger generation, the importance of atmospheric and environmental sciences, approaches in the Earth system modelling and their applications.
    This School is organized in the Memory of Professor Sergej Zilitinkevich.

This website contains all of the details and materials for the school, along with resources for further learning and practice. The materials shared here are free and open source and may be shared and adapted under the [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Expected audience: bachelor, master and PhD students, young scientists in hydrogeochemestry, ecology, hydrology and other areas.

All registered participants of the school will get a certificate of the attendance (upon request). Please note the LOC will follow the presence of the participants during lectures. We reserve the right to reject the certificate delivery in case of "no show".


*The School is organized with the financial support from the Russian Science Foundation (grant No 19-77-30004).*
