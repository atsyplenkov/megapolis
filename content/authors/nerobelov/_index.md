Georgii Nerobelov is a post-graduate student of St. Petersburg State University, Atmospheric physics department. He has BSc and MSc degrees in applied hydrometeorology (Russian State Hydrometeorological University). Georgii specializes in numerical modeling of the transport of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere on regional and global scales and in the assessment of anthropogenic GHG emissions from the territories of megacities. His research interests also include online integrated numerical modeling of the effect of aerosols on meteorological parameters at the regional and city scales, modeling of aerosol transport, atmospheric pollution, remote sensing of greenhouse gases, dynamics of carbon dioxide and ozone in the atmosphere. He has experience in working with the Enviro-HIRLAM and WRF-Chem regional numerical models, the GEOS-Chem global model and HYSPLIT and STILT particle dispersion models. In addition, he has skills in analyzing measurements and reanalysis of meteorological parameters and atmospheric composition conducted by different services (ECMWF, CAMS). Georgii takes part as a researcher in several international research projects such as “RI-URBANS” (in in the framework of HORIZON 2020), “Enviro-PEEX(Plus) on ECMWF” and others.
